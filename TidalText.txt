Tidal Trip Planner

Welcome fellow Turkers! We require you to help someone plan a trip. We would require you to do ONE of the following of your choice:
1. Break Tasks-Break major itinerary milestones into smaller sub-tasks. Eg: Break Day 1 of trip into sub-tasks say: Travel, Accomodation and Sightseeing.
2. Solve Tasks-Solve the sub-tasks. Eg: Get Hotel info, nearby attractions, flight info.
3. Glue Tasks -Combine information  Eg: Combine all above information

Note: 
-Break Task involves casual monitoring of the created sub-tasks.
-All submitted tasks are approved by fellow Turkers


Here's how we're different from most HITs:
1. We aim for an hourly pay rate of $8-9/hr and pay for small breaks at $1.20/hr. Each approved task you do earns $0.50.
2. While waiting on us, leave our Tab open, take a break or do other AMT HITs. We pay your break time and will notify you if a new task appears.
3. We provide a steady stream of tasks right to you. No page reloads or re-accepting HITs.
4. The more tasks you do, the higher is your ranking compared to other workers and the harder we try to help you earn more. 

Note: 
- Each approved task you do within a HIT earns you $0.50. 
- The base HIT amount is $0.50 and every additional task you do earns you $0.50. 
- We pay the amount you earn per task as bonuses.

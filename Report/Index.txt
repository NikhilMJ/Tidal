Abstract:
Various crowd-sourcing platforms such as AMT[1], allow for a conducive online work eco-system that provides fast access to workers and micro-jobs at the user's will. This allows for a host of interesting application venues. We aim at providing a self-regulatory task framework that is capable of solving relatively complex tasks in a timely manner. The task structure is managed through self-supervision, while the worker pool is managed through. An active pool of workers is maintained within AMT[1] to provide workers. to workers.  solve more complex tasks to be broken up and a self-regulated 

Introduction:
Crowdsourcing is the process by which information, ideas and services are obtained from generally a large base of online users. Various platforms[1][2][3] are available for crowd-sourcing. The tasks put out by requesters on these platforms range from micro-tasks such as labelling to more involving jobs that require greater involvement. Others such as reCAPTCHA[4] while being used other purposes such as spam prevention, authentication etc. are also used for providing crowd-sourced information. A more detailed taxonomy of such platforms is provided in [4].
